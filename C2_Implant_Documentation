*****DOCUMENTATION FOR C2 AND IMPLANT API*****
Assumptions:
C2 have...
-asymmetric key pair (Ek, Dk)
-authorize code
-Zp, g

Agent have...
-c2's public key (Ek)
-authorize code
-Zp, g

*****To check in/authorize*****
implant -> c2 with /checkin

Parameters: (Use c2's public key's to encrypt parameters)
*authorize code 
*agent's id
*check in time
*connecting ip address
*sleep time (time before next call)
*Diffie Hellman's key exchange (give g^a mod p) = s0

Response:
*statue of the checkin
*diffie hellman's key exchange (give g^b mod p) = s1

Flow:
C2 decrypts body using its secret key, authorize the "authorize code".
if correct: save agent's id, check in time, connecting ip, next checkin time and generates key exchange (g^b mod p) = s1 and send ("success", s1) to agent. save session id = s0^b mod p
if incorrect: don't reply

After successful api call:
C2 saved agent in database, C2 and agent also have a shared symmetric key that they can use for communication
